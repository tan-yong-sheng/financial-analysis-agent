# Analysis Agent

The Analysis Agent is responsible for analyzing financial data and generating insights. It combines algorithmic financial analysis with LLM-powered qualitative assessments to produce comprehensive financial analysis.

## Functionality

The Analysis Agent:

1. Receives financial data and research results
2. Performs quantitative analysis of financial statements and metrics
3. Uses LLM to generate qualitative insights and interpretations
4. Integrates financial analysis with market research
5. Returns comprehensive analysis results

## Implementation

The Analysis Agent is implemented in the `AnalysisAgent` class:

```python
class AnalysisAgent(BaseAgent):
    """Agent responsible for analyzing financial data and generating insights."""
    
    def __init__(self, base_url: str = None, model_name: str = None):
        role = "a financial analyst that interprets financial data and identifies key trends and insights"
        super().__init__(role, "Financial Analyst", base_url=base_url, model_name=model_name)
        self.analyzer = FinancialAnalyzer()
    
    def analyze_financial_data(self, financial_data: Dict[str, Any], research_plan: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Analyze financial data based on the research plan."""
        # Implementation details...
    
    def integrate_market_research(self, analysis_results: Dict[str, Any], research_results: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Integrate market research with financial analysis."""
        # Implementation details...
    
    def process(self, input_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Process input data to analyze financial information."""
        # Implementation details...
```

## Input

The Analysis Agent takes a JSON object containing:

```json
{
  "financial_data": {
    "company_profile": [...],
    "income_statement": [...],
    "balance_sheet": [...],

## Key Methods

### `analyze_financial_data(financial_data, research_plan)`

Performs comprehensive analysis of financial data:

1. Uses the FinancialAnalyzer module to perform quantitative analysis
2. Extracts company information from the data
3. Uses LLM to generate qualitative insights about the financial data
4. Combines quantitative metrics with qualitative assessments

### `integrate_market_research(analysis_results, research_results)`

Integrates financial analysis with market research:

1. Identifies connections between financial performance and market events/trends
2. Evaluates how competitive position affects financial results
3. Assesses how industry trends might impact future financial performance
4. Determines if financial data aligns with or contradicts market perception
5. Provides a holistic assessment of the company's position and outlook

### `process(input_data)`

The main entry point that:

1. Validates the input data
2. Extracts financial data, research results, and research plan
3. Analyzes the financial data
4. Integrates with market research if available
5. Returns comprehensive analysis results

## Financial Analysis

The Analysis Agent uses the FinancialAnalyzer module to perform quantitative analysis, which includes:

- Income statement analysis (revenue trends, profit margins, growth rates)
- Balance sheet analysis (liquidity, leverage, asset efficiency)
- Cash flow analysis (operating cash flow, free cash flow, cash usage)
- Technical indicators analysis (moving averages, RSI, MACD, etc.)

## JSON Serialization

The Analysis Agent employs special handling for NumPy data types through:

1. The DataTransformer's NumpyEncoder for proper JSON serialization
2. The convert_numpy_types function to ensure all data is JSON-serializable

This prevents common errors like "Object of type int64 is not JSON serializable."

## Example Usage

```python
from agents.analysis_agent import AnalysisAgent

# Initialize the agent
analyst = AnalysisAgent()

# Create input data
input_data = {
    "financial_data": collected_financial_data,
    "research_results": research_results,
    "research_plan": research_plan
}

# Perform analysis
analysis_results = analyst.process(input_data)

# Access analysis components
quantitative = analysis_results.get("financial_analysis", {}).get("quantitative_analysis", {})
qualitative = analysis_results.get("financial_analysis", {}).get("qualitative_analysis", {})
integrated = analysis_results.get("integrated_insights", {})

# Use the analysis results
print(f"Revenue growth: {quantitative.get('income_analysis', {}).get('growth', {}).get('revenue_growth')}%")
print(f"Key strength: {qualitative.get('financial_strengths', [''])[0]}")
```
