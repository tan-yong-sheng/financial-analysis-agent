# Testing Documentation

The Financial Analysis System uses a comprehensive testing framework to ensure reliability and maintainability.

## Overview

The testing framework provides:
- Unit testing for all components
- Integration testing for component interactions
- Test fixtures for common scenarios
- Mocking utilities for external dependencies
- Coverage reporting

## Documentation

- [Writing Tests](writing-tests.md) - Guide for writing tests for new components
- [Coverage](coverage.md) - Guide for maintaining test coverage standards

## Key Features

1. **Test Organization**
   - Clear directory structure
   - Component-specific test files
   - Shared fixtures and utilities

2. **Test Types**
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - Agent behavior tests
   - API interaction tests
   - Logging validation tests

3. **Test Utilities**
   - Mock LLM responses
   - Sample financial data
   - API response fixtures
   - Testing decorators

4. **Best Practices**
   - Clear test case naming
   - Comprehensive assertions
   - Error case testing
   - Performance validation
   - Logging verification
