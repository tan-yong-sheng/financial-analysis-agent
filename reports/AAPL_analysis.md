## Financial Analysis

## Financial Analysis

This section provides a detailed analysis of Apple's financial performance, focusing on its income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement. We examine key financial metrics, trends, and ratios to assess the company's profitability, liquidity, and solvency.

### Income Statement Analysis

Apple's revenue for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2024, was \$391.04 billion[1], representing a 2.02% increase[1] compared to the previous year (\$383.29 billion)[1]. However, net income decreased by 3.36%[1] to \$93.74 billion[1] from \$96.99 billion[1] in 2023. This decline in net income despite revenue growth suggests increasing costs or other factors impacting profitability.

Key income statement metrics include:

-   **Revenue Growth:** 2.02% (2024)[1]
-   **Gross Margin:** 46.21% (2024)[1]
-   **Operating Margin:** 31.51% (2024)[1]
-   **Profit Margin:** 23.97% (2024)[1]

The gross margin improved from 44.13% in 2023[1] to 46.21% in 2024[1], indicating better cost management or higher pricing power. However, the operating margin and profit margin decreased slightly, suggesting that operating expenses grew at a faster rate than revenue.

| Metric          | 2024   | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |
| --------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Revenue (B USD) | 391.04 | 383.29 | 394.33 | 365.82 | 274.52 |
| Net Income (B USD) | 93.74  | 96.99  | 99.80  | 94.68  | 57.41  |
| Gross Margin (%) | 46.21  | 44.13  | 43.31  | 41.78  | 38.23  |
| Operating Margin (%) | 31.51  | 29.82  | 30.29  | 29.78  | 24.15  |
| Profit Margin (%) | 23.97  | 25.31  | 25.31  | 25.88  | 20.91  |

### Balance Sheet Analysis

Apple's balance sheet reflects a strong financial position, although with a significant amount of debt. As of September 28, 2024, total assets were \$364.98 billion[1], and total liabilities were \$308.03 billion[1], resulting in stockholders' equity of \$56.95 billion[1].

Key balance sheet ratios include:

-   **Current Ratio:** 0.87 (2024)[1]
-   **Debt-to-Assets Ratio:** 0.84 (2024)[1]
-   **Return on Assets:** 0.16 (2024)[1]

The current ratio of 0.87 indicates that Apple may have some liquidity challenges in the short term, as current liabilities exceed current assets. The debt-to-assets ratio of 0.84 suggests a high level of leverage, which could increase financial risk. The return on assets of 0.16 indicates that Apple is generating a reasonable profit from its assets.

### Cash Flow Analysis

Apple's cash flow statement reveals strong operating cash flow but significant cash outflows for financing activities, primarily share repurchases and dividends.

Key cash flow metrics include:

-   **Operating Cash Flow:** \$118.25 billion (2024)[1]
-   **Capital Expenditure:** -\$9.45 billion (2024)[1]
-   **Free Cash Flow:** \$108.81 billion (2024)[1]

Apple generated \$118.25 billion in cash from operating activities in 2024[1]. Capital expenditures were \$9.45 billion[1], resulting in a free cash flow of \$108.81 billion[1]. However, financing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of \$121.98 billion[1], primarily due to share repurchases (\$94.95 billion)[1] and dividends paid (\$15.23 billion)[1].

| Metric (B USD) | 2024   | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |
| --------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Operating Cash Flow | 118.25 | 110.54 | 122.15 | 104.04 | 80.67  |
| Capital Expenditure | -9.45  | -10.96 | -10.71 | -11.09 | -7.31  |
| Free Cash Flow | 108.81 | 99.58  | 111.44 | 92.95  | 73.37  |

Apple's consistent generation of substantial free cash flow provides the company with financial flexibility to invest in growth opportunities, return capital to shareholders, and manage its debt. However, the significant cash outflows for share repurchases and dividends should be carefully evaluated to ensure they are sustainable and do not compromise the company's long-term financial health.
